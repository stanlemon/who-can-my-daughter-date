# Who Can My Daughter Date?

A humorous questionnaire application that evaluates dating compatibility based on important life choices like sports team allegiance, pizza toppings, and condiment preferences. Built with React 19, TypeScript, Vite, and Biome.

## Features

- 🏈 NFL team preference evaluation (Browns fans need not apply)
- 🍕 Pineapple pizza opinion assessment
- 🌭 Hot dog ketchup stance verification
- ⛪ Lutheran affiliation inquiry
- ⚡ Immediate disqualification for deal-breakers
- 🎨 Color-coded verdict system (green/yellow/red)
- 🌙 Dark mode support
- ♿ Fully accessible with ARIA labels
- 📱 Responsive design for all devices

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.20.0 (see `.nvmrc`)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- nvm (recommended for Node version management)

## Getting Started

### Install Node.js version

Using nvm:

```bash
nvm install
nvm use
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally
- `npm test` - Run tests once
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:ui` - Run tests with UI
- `npm run lint` - Check code for linting errors with Biome
- `npm run lint:fix` - Fix linting errors automatically with Biome
- `npm run format` - Format code with Biome
- `npm run type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking

## Tech Stack

- **React 19** - UI library
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Vite 7** - Build tool and dev server
- **Vitest** - Unit testing framework
- **React Testing Library** - Component testing utilities
- **Biome** - Code linting and formatting

## Testing

Tests are written using Vitest and React Testing Library. All components should have comprehensive test coverage.

Run tests:
```bash
npm test
```

Run tests in watch mode during development:
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

## Deployment to Cloudflare Pages

### Option 1: Connect GitHub Repository (Recommended)

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Go to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)
3. Click "Create a project" and connect your GitHub repository
4. Configure build settings:
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Build output directory**: `dist`
   - **Root directory**: `/`
   - **Node version**: Set environment variable `NODE_VERSION=22.20.0`
5. Click "Save and Deploy"

Cloudflare Pages will automatically deploy on every push to your main branch.

### Option 2: Deploy via Wrangler CLI

Install Wrangler:
```bash
npm install -g wrangler
```

Login to Cloudflare:
```bash
wrangler login
```

Deploy:
```bash
npm run build
wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=who-can-my-daughter-date
```

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflow is configured to:
- Run linting
- Run type checking
- Run tests
- Build the application
- Upload build artifacts

The workflow runs on every push to `main` and on pull requests.

## How It Works

The application uses a config-driven questionnaire evaluation system:

1. **Questions** are defined in `src/config/questionnaire.ts` with answer options
2. **Immediate Disqualifiers** are marked on specific answers (e.g., Cleveland Browns)
3. **Rules** evaluate answer combinations with priority ordering
4. **Verdicts** are determined by matching rules:
   - **Immediate No**: Big red X overlay (e.g., Browns fans, pineapple enthusiasts)
   - **Rejected**: Red summary banner (e.g., multiple bad takes)
   - **Conditional**: Yellow banner (e.g., questionable but not disqualifying)
   - **Approved**: Green banner (e.g., Steelers fan with good food opinions)
